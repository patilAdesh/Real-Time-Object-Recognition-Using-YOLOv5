# Real-Time Object Detection Web Application

## Overview

This project presents a web application for real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model. The application leverages a webcam to capture live video feeds and performs object detection in real time. The web app is designed with a user-friendly interface, using Bootstrap for responsive design and enhanced with CSS for an engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv5 to detect objects from a live webcam feed.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across a range of devices from desktops to mobile phones.
- **User Instructions:** Provides clear and concise instructions on how to use the application.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:** Incorporates Bootstrap and custom CSS for an attractive and functional user interface.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 dependencies

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-object-detection.git
   cd real-time-object-detection
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download YOLOv5 Model:**
   Download the YOLOv5 model weights from the [YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) and place the model file (`yolov5s.pt` recommended) in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

2. **Access the Web App:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Start Live Detection:**
   - On the home page, click the "Start Live Detection" button.
   - Ensure your webcam is connected and the browser has permissions to use it.

4. **How to Use:**
   - Click on "How to Use" to view detailed instructions on utilizing the web application for object detection.
